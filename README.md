# Tinkerbox Configs 

These are the dotfiles for my own meta distro based on Gentoo. The goal of these dotfiles were to accomplish the following:

- Minimal and clean setup
- Mouseless experience (expect in gaming ...)
- Auto theming and pretty

These dotfiles were all symlinked using Gnu Stow.

## Programs

Currently what I am running that is directly configured is the following: 

| Category | Program |
| ------ | ------ |
| OS | Gentoo |
| WM | bspwm |
| WB | Firefox + Tridactyl |
| Terminal | st |
| Editor | Vim |
| Shell | Bash |
| Bar | Polybar |
| Themer | pywal |

## Screenshots
